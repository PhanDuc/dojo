# dōjō (道場)
"is a hall or space for immersive learning or meditation. This is traditionally in the field of martial arts, but has been seen increasingly in other fields, such as meditation and software development. The term literally means "place of the Way" in Japanese." [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C5%8Dj%C5%8D)

This space I'll be using for push results of exercises on Computer Science, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering and more ∞, I  don't want to scatter or occupy my Github of exercises and meditations results in different repositories, I wish to keep this 道場 for it.
